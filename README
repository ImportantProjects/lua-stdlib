                        Standard Lua libraries
                        ----------------------

     by the stdlib project (http://luaforge.net/projects/stdlib/)


This is a collection of Lua libraries for Lua 5.1. The libraries are
copyright by their authors 2000-2006 (see the AUTHORS file for
details), and released under the MIT license (the same license as Lua
itself). There is no warranty.


Installation
------------

The archive should be unpacked somewhere on LUA_PATH.


Use
---

The libraries are divided into categories. Individual libraries may be
loaded with e.g.

require "std.io.getopt"

alternatively a whole category may be loaded with

require "std.string"

or the entire library with

require "std"

Each library will automatically load any other libraries it needs.

The libraries are documented in a LuaDoc-like style, and HTML
documentation is produced by the included ldoc script. (There's
currently no Lua 5 version of LuaDoc).


Bug reports and code contributions
----------------------------------

Please make bug reports on LuaForge (see URL at top of file).

There is also a mailing list for discussing the libraries,
stdlib@lists.luaforge.net. You can subscribe on the project page.

These libraries are maintained and extended by their users. If you
have some code you think would be useful in the libraries, please
write to the mailing list.
