                        Standard Lua libraries
                        ----------------------

                    by Reuben Thomas (rrt@sc3d.org)


This archive contains a collection of Lua libraries for Lua 5.0. The
libraries are copyright Reuben Thomas 2000-2002 (except for some code
adapted from the Lua distribution, which is acknowledged), and
released under the MIT license (basically the same as the BSD license,
and the same license as Lua itself). There is no warranty.


Help and bug reports
--------------------

I want to make these libraries into a set of standard libraries that
everyone can use. To this end, I've added them to the lua-users
project on SourceForge. Feel free to pitch in and help! (For a
rationale, see http://lua-users.org/wiki/StandardLibraryProposal).


Installation
------------

The archive should be unpacked in /usr/local/share/lua or equivalent.


Use
---

The libraries are divided into categories. Individual libraries may be
loaded with e.g.

require "std/text/regex"

alternatively a whole category may be loaded with

require "std/text"

or the entire library with

require "std"

Each library will automatically load any other libraries it needs.

The libraries are documented in a LuaDoc-like style, and I hope to
convert this to LuaDoc in the near future.
