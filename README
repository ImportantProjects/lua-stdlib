                        Standard Lua libraries
                        ----------------------

             by the lua-users project (www.lua-users.org)


This is a collection of Lua libraries for Lua 5.0. The libraries are
copyright by their authors 2000-2005 (see the AUTHORS file for
details), and released under the MIT license (the same license as Lua
itself). There is no warranty.


Installation
------------

The archive should be unpacked in /usr/local/share/lua or equivalent.


Use
---

The libraries are divided into categories. Individual libraries may be
loaded with e.g.

require "std.text.regex"

alternatively a whole category may be loaded with

require "std.text"

or the entire library with

require "std"

Each library will automatically load any other libraries it needs.

The libraries are documented in a LuaDoc-like style, and I hope to
convert this to real LuaDoc (when LuaDoc 3 emerges) in the near
future.
